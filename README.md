### üí° About the App
The SME sector plays a very important role because it has a huge influence on the wheels of the Indonesian economy. Minister of Cooperatives and SMEs Teten Masduki said that 60% of the national Gross Domestic Product is supported by the MSME sector and absorbs 97% of the total workforce.

However, most of them are less able to compete, one of which is in creating a brand, design and packaging. These factors can add value to business products, introduce business products to the wider community through digital media, attract potential customers, and maintain consumer loyalty. Meanwhile, SMEs are still constrained by creating attractive designs and content for their products.

This is where digital marketing agency services can help business people improve their sales performance by implementing a marketing strategy. It was found that digital marketing strategies have an effect of up to 78% on the competitive advantage of SMEs in marketing their products.

SMEs need people in the digital marketing field, but they tend to get troubled finding the right people to do the job. They need a platform where they can discover talents, hire them, and also transact safely in using digital marketers services.

Therefore, we created a platform called PasarVisual, which is a platform that is devoted to bringing together MSME business people and digital marketers, so that business people can easily find and use digital marketing services to help them strengthen product exposure from their business in digital media.
